Timing is everything

	amazing product, amazing team, lots of funding

		but wrong timing?

			you're fucked

netflix wouldn't have worked if broadband connections weren't widespread

uber, airbnb would be silly launching during the corona virus

	they both launched in a recession and that propelled them to success because people were looking for anything that could make them extra money, even if it meant doing weird things

coding bootcamps would be weird when computers were really new and the economy was booming. 

	The recession was what helped push people to coding bootcamps to take advantage of a skills gap in a field that pays well
