                        <h2>About Me</h2>

                        <p>Hey I'm Pavan. I was an early stage C-level executive at Trilogy Education Services in late 2015. We attained Product Market Fit (PMF) fairly quickly and were acquired for $750M in mid 2019.</p>

                        <p>After the exit, I was asked to give a talk about PMF.</p>

                        <p>That's when I realized that I had no framework for attaining PMF. As an angel investor, I knew of signs to look for in a startup that allude to a future PMF, but that's all.</p>

                        <p>That's when I embarked upon studying PMF. I spent 100s of hours reading, taking notes and discussing PMF with founders. <b>This guide is the culmination of my journey.</b></p>

                                <p>I made a huge outline over the course of months, and i'm in the process of extrapolating it out into this guide.</p>

                                <p>I plan to add a quiz, a deck and a series of documents to accompany this guide.</p>

                                   <li><b>Effort:</b> What effort has the user put in to solving this problem already? Users that are actively trying to solve this problem are the ones you REALLY want to LISTEN to.</li>

                                    <p>Hubspot Sidekick was a business that generated $100M ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue).</p>

                                    <p>The product would track emails you send out and when the recipients opened emails, it would notify you through a chrome extension.</p>

                                    <p>I was one of the first premium users of this product. I used it when I was doing business development for INRTracker.com, a startup I founded in 2014.</p>

                                      <li><b>Effort:</b> Constantly following up via email and phone. Attend sales training.</li>

                                      <li><b>Motivation:</b> A couple of motivations:

                                        <ol>
                                          <li>Money. Knowing where a prospect was led to better prioritization and selling, which led to more closing.</li>
                                          <li>Uncertainty. The target audience's life was filled with constant uncertainty. Relieving that uncertainty was a big deal.</li>
                                          <li>Competition (berating other reps)</li>
                                        </ol>

                                      <li><b>Problem:</b> Not knowing where a prospect or client stood in the process, shooting blind. Other problems: hates inputting data into CRM, sales training is useless.</li>
