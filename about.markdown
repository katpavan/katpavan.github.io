Hey I'm Pavan. I was an early stage C-level executive at Trilogy Education Services. We attained Product Market Fit fairly quickly and were acquired for $750M in mid 2019.

Since 2019, I've invested $500k of my own money into startups. I do 2-4 deals a year, and I write checks anywhere from $25k to $100k. If you're a startup founder and you have great metrics, reach out to me. 

After the exit, I was asked to give a talk about Product Market Fit. Quickly, I realized that I didn't know anything. I knew what success looks like, how to find early customers, but I didn't have a repeatable playbook that I could just hand an entrepreneur. 

That's when I embarked upon studying PMF. I spent 100s of hours reading, taking notes and talking with founders. My writing is the culmination of this journey. And I never want this journey to end.
