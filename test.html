                    <br><br>
                    <p>By Pavan Katepalli</p>

                    <p>I was an early stage C-level executive at Trilogy Education Services. We attained Product Market Fit (PMF) fairly quickly and were acquired for $750M in 2019.</p>

                    <p>Later that year, I was asked to give a talk about PMF.</p>

                    <p>That's when I realized that as an angel investor I know the signs of PMF, but had no framework for attaining it.</p>

                    <p>That's when I embarked upon learning. I spent 100s of hours reading, taking notes and discussing PMF with founders. <b>This guide is the culmination of my journey.</b></p>
