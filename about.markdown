## Web3

I run Yomi Games, a web3 game studio. We've done a [lot](https://yomigames.medium.com/), but it's nothing compared to what we're doing next.

Before that, I was a Blockchain Solutions Architect at Consensys. Consensys was founded by Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum. MetaMask was made at Consensys, the first ever wallet for decentralized applications.

## Trilogy

I was an early stage C-level executive at Trilogy Education Services. We attained Product Market Fit fairly quickly and were acquired for $750M in mid 2019.

## Angel Investing 

Since 2019, I've invested $1M of my own money into startups.
