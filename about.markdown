Hey I'm Pavan. I was an early stage C-level executive at Trilogy Education Services. We attained Product Market Fit fairly quickly and were acquired for $750M in mid 2019.

After the exit, I was asked to give a talk about PMF.

That's when I realized that I had no framework for attaining PMF. As an angel investor, I knew of signs to look for that allude to a future PMF, but that's all.

That's when I embarked upon studying PMF. I spent 100s of hours reading, taking notes and talking with founders. My writing is the culmination of this journey. And I never want this journey to end.
