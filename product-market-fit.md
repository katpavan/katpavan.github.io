I really like how the quiz is embedded with the content

	it would be cool if there were two checkmarks at the top of the table of contents

	content
	quiz

	this way they can uncheck the content part and take the quiz

		maybe this is too confusing 

			yeah it is

strtup boost newsletter - jason said he'd put it in there

coming up with the idea

	What you should do is manually verify that everything is solid. be as unscalable as possible in the beginning to force yourself to deeply connect with the processes, customers, businesses and the true hidden needs in the marketplace.

	Most people build too early and they end up with a massive amount of tech debt, processes that don't make sense and they focus too much on the product rather than the customer.

	Everyone tries to achieve product market fit, but they do the product part first. Do the market part first. Focus on the market. The product comes after.

Timing is everything

	amazing product, amazing team, lots of funding

		but wrong timing?

			you're fucked

	the questions you should ask are

	what things happening in the world right now will accelerate my business

	of course the world changes and either your business fits or doesn't. Ex: Coronavirus. But that shouldn't stop you, if you've answered the above question effectively.

prototype

	use webflow

	google forms, typeforms whatever

	zapier

	and manually do your service

netflix wouldn't have worked if broadband connections weren't widespread

uber, airbnb would be silly launching during the corona virus

	they both launched in a recession and that propelled them to success because people were looking for anything that could make them extra money, even if it meant doing weird things

coding bootcamps would be weird when computers were really new and the economy was booming. 

	The recession was what helped push people to coding bootcamps to take advantage of a skills gap in a field that pays well
