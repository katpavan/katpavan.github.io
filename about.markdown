## Trilogy

Hey I'm Pavan. I was an early stage C-level executive at Trilogy Education Services. We attained Product Market Fit fairly quickly and were acquired for $750M in mid 2019.

After the exit, I needed to put what happened with Trilogy into a playbook that I could use for my next Company.

That's when I embarked upon studying PMF. I spent hundreds of hours reading, taking notes and talking with founders. My writing is the culmination of this journey.

## Angel Investing 

Since 2019, I've invested $1M of my own money into startups. I do two to four deals a year, and I write checks anywhere from $25k to $100k. If you're a startup founder and you have great metrics, reach out to me.
